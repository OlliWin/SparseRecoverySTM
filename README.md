# SparseRecoverySTM
This is a MATLAB toolkit, containing 3 classes and 1 script.

The 3 classes make it possible to perform compressed sensing for a sparse sample of an n-dimensional signal. The working mechanism of the toolkit relies on spgl1 and it also needs to be downloaded so that this toolkit works.
